Shopping Mall Navigation 

The normal shopping malls are crowded and have variety of different brands selling different items. This can sometimes lead to confusion for buyers as there are several shops and choosing the right one for shopping can be really tough. 

Our Shopping mall navigation system solves the problem for the buyers. The website consists of search engine where a user can easily search for a particular shop or search for a particular item he / she wishes to buy and will get to know the best outlet to buy the certain item. Not only that, the project consists of a navigation system that can be used to get directions to any particular shop or position of the mall from the current positions.
